This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (except murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to the present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. To protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.
